**AI vs ML vs DL vs Data Science**
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is about making computers act smart like humans, such as thinking and making decisions. Machine Learning (ML) is part of AI where computers learen from data instead of being directly programmed. Dep Learning (DL) is a type of ML that uses big neural networks to solve hard problems like face recognition and speech. Data Science is about collecting, cleaning, and studying data to find useful information. It uses math, coding, and tools to understand what the data means. While AI focuses on making machines smart, Data Science focuses on learning from data to help people make better decisions.
